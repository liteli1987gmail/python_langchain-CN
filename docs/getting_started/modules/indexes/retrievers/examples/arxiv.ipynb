The approach uses the binding property of images to align each modality's embedding to image embeddings and achieve an emergent alignment across all modalities. This enables novel multimodal capabilities, including cross-modal retrieval, embedding-space arithmetic, and audio-to-image generation, among others. The approach sets a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Additionally, it shows strong few-shot recognition results and serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks. \n", "\n", "-> **Question**: How does Compositional Reasoning with Large Language Models works? \n", "\n", "**Answer**: Compositional reasoning with large language models refers to the ability of these models to correctly identify and represent complex concepts by breaking them down into smaller, more basic parts and combining them in a structured way.

Probing Compositionality in Large Image Models\", the authors focus specifically on the ability of a large pretrained vision and language model (CLIP) to encode compositional concepts and to bind variables in a structure-sensitive way.
