Welcome to LangChain
==========================

| **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
1. *Data-aware*: connect a language model to other sources of data
2. *Agentic*: allow a language model to interact with its environment

| The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.

| This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see `here <https://docs.langchain.com/docs/>`_. For the JavaScript documentation, see `here <https://js.langchain.com/docs/>`_.

Modules
-----------

| These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.
For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LangChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.

| The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.

| The modules are (from least to most complex):

- `Models <./modules/models.html>`_: Supported model types and integrations.

- `Prompts <./modules/prompts.html>`_: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.

- `Memory <./modules/memory.html>`_: Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.

- `Indexes <./modules/indexes.html>`_: Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.

- `Chains <./modules/chains.html>`_: Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).

- `Agents <./modules/agents.html>`_: An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.

- `Callbacks <./modules/callbacks/getting_started.html>`_: Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.

Use Cases
----------

| Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:

- `Autonomous Agents <./use_cases/autonomous_agents.html>`_: Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.

- `Agent Simulations <./use_cases/agent_simulations.html>`_: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.

- `Personal Assistants <./use_cases/personal_assistants.html>`_: One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.

- `Question Answering <./use_cases/question_answering.html>`_: Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.

- `Chatbots <./use_cases/chatbots.html>`_: Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.

- `Querying Tabular Data <./use_cases/tabular.html>`_: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).

- `Code Understanding <./use_cases/code.html>`_: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.

- `Interacting with APIs <./use_cases/apis.html>`_: Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.

- `Extraction <./use_cases/extraction.html>`_: Extract structured information from text.

- `Summarization <./use_cases/summarization.html>`_: Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.

- `Evaluation <./use_cases/evaluation.html>`_: Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.
