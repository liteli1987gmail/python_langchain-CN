    "## REACT Agent Chat Message History Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://getzep.github.io/) as memory for your chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.\n",
    "2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.\n",
    "3. Viewing the enriched messages.\n",
    "4. Vector search over the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on Zep:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zep stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.\n",
    "- Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.\n",
    "- Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.\n",
    "- Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.\n",
    "- Python and JavaScript SDKs.\n",
