# Agent Simulations

Agent simulations involve interacting one of more agents with eachother.
Agent simulations generally involve two main components:

- Long Term Memory
- Simulation Environment

Specific implementations of agent simulations (or parts of agent simulations) include

## CAMEL
- [CAMEL](agent_simulations/camel_role_playing.ipynb): an implementation of the CAMEL (Communicative Agents for “Mind” Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society) paper, where two agents communicate with eachother.

## Generative Agents
- [Generative Agents](agent_simulations/characters.ipynb): This notebook implements a generative agent based on the paper [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Park, et. al.
